The TAPR Open Hardware License Version 1.0 (May 25, 2007) Copyright 2007 TAPR - http://www.tapr.org/OHL PREAMBLE Open Hardware is a thing - a physical artifact, either electrical or mechanical - whose design information is available to, and usable by, the public in a way that allows anyone to make, modify, distribute, and use that thing In this preface, design information is called "documentation" and things created from it are called "products." The TAPR Open Hardware License ("OHL") agreement provides a legal framework for Open Hardware projects It may be used for any kind of product, be it a hammer or a computer motherboard, and is TAPR's contribution to the community; anyone may use the OHL for their Open Hardware project. Like the GNU General Public License, the OHL is designed to guarantee your freedom to share and to create It forbids anyone who receives rights under the OHL to deny any other licensee those same rights to copy, modify, and distribute documentation, and to make, use and distribute products based on that documentation. Unlike the GPL, the OHL is not primarily a copyright license While copyright protects documentation from unauthorized copying, modification, and distribution, it has little to do with your right to make, distribute, or use a product based on that documentation For better or worse, patents play a significant role in those activities Although it does not prohibit anyone from patenting inventions embodied in an Open Hardware design, and of course cannot prevent a third party from enforcing their patent rights, those who benefit from an OHL design may not bring lawsuits claiming that design infringes their patents or other intellectual property. The OHL addresses unique issues involved in the creation of tangible, physical things, but does not cover software, firmware, or code loaded into programmable devices
