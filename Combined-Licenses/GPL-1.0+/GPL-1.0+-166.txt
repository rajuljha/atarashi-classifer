Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\r\nmodifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means\r\nall the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special\r\nexception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard\r\nlibraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable\r\nfile runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that\r\naccompany that operating system.
