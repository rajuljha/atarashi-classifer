Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example), and so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the contents of the Database individually Licensors should use the ODbL together with another license for the contents, if the contents have a single set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents
