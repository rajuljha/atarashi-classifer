      3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with other software code not governed by the terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including, but not limited to, performance warranties and non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No Contributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) who made Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
