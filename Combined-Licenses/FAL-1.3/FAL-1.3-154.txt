- Historical background of this license: \r\nIt is the result of observing, using and creating digital technologies, free software, the Internet and art. It arose from the \xe2\x80\x9cCopyleft Attitude\xe2\x80\x9d meetings which took place in Paris in 2000. For the first time, these meetings brought together members of the Free Software community, artists, and members of the art world. The goal was to adapt the principles of Copyleft and free software to all sorts of creations. http://www.artlibre.org
