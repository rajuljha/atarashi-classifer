Python 2.4.4 license This is the official license for the Python 2.4 release: A HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ========================== Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others. In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software. In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation, see http://www.zope.com) In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of the PSF. All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for the Open Source Definition) Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its license has a choice of law clause According to CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is "not incompatible" with the GPL. Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.
