Public domain software is software that is not copyrighted If the source code is in the public domain, that is a special case of noncopylefted free software, which means that some copies or modified versions may not be free at all. In some cases, an executable program can be in the public domain but the source code is not available This is not free software, because free software requires accessibility of source code
