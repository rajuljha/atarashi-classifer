If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your\r\nWork, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'.  \r\nHowever, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance\r\nsection was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to\r\nthe community even when you can no longer maintain and support it\r\nyourself.
