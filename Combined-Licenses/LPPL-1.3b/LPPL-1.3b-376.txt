Several clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and\r\nstability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves\r\nwith the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a\r\n(compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If\r\nthis is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a\r\ncompletely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.
