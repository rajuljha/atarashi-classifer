Following the release of Python 1.6, and after Guido van Rossum left\r\nCNRI to work with commercial software developers, it became clear that\r\nthe ability to use Python with software available under the GNU Public\r\nLicense (GPL) was very desirable.  CNRI and the Free Software\r\nFoundation (FSF) interacted to develop enabling wording changes to the\r\nPython license.  Python 1.6.1 is essentially the same as Python 1.6,\r\nwith a few minor bug fixes, and with a different license that enables\r\nlater versions to be GPL-compatible.  Python 2.1 is a derivative work\r\nof Python 1.6.1, as well as of Python 2.0.
