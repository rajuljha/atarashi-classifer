It is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own personal use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for distributing the modified file. While you might intend that such modified files will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license. It is usually in your best interest to keep your copy of The Program identical with the public one. Many programs provide ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its licensed files.
