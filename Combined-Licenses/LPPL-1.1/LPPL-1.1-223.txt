If for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your program under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your program is distributed under the LPPL.
