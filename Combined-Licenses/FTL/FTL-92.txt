The FreeType Project LICENSE 2006-Jan-27 Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg Introduction The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project. This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least. This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike As a consequence, its main points are that: o We don't promise that this software works However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports (`as is' distribution) o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us (`royalty-free' usage) o You may not pretend that you wrote this software If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code (`credits') We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project. Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license We thus encourage you to use the following text: """ Portions of this software are copyright \xc2\xa9 <year> The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org) All rights reserved """ Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you actually use. Legal Terms 0 Definitions Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project', and `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release. `You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable' This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType engine'. This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.
