LaTeX Project Public License LPPL Version 1.0 1999-03-01 Copyright 1999 LaTeX3 Project Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but modification is not allowed. Preamble The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the license under which the base LaTeX distribution is distributed As described below you may use this licence for any software that you wish to distribute. It may be particularly suitable if your software is TeX related (such as a LaTeX package file) but it may be used for any software, even if it is unrelated to TeX. To use this license, the files of your distribution should have an explicit copyright notice giving your name and the year, together with a reference to this license. A typical example would be %% pig.sty %% Copyright 2001 M Y Name % This program can redistributed and/or modified under the terms % of the LaTeX Project Public License Distributed from CTAN % archives in directory macros/latex/base/lppl.txt; either % version 1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. Given such a notice in the file, the conditions of this document would apply, with: `The Program' referring to the software `pig.sty' and `The Copyright Holder' referring to the person `M Y Name'. To see a real example, see the file legal.txt which carries the copyright notice for the base latex distribution. This license gives terms under which files of The Program may be distributed and modified Individual files may have specific further constraints on modification, but no file should have restrictions on distribution other than those specified below. This is to ensure that a distributor wishing to distribute a complete unmodified copy of The Program need only check the conditions in this file, and does not need to check every file in The Program for extra restrictions If you do need to modify the distribution terms of some files, do not refer to this license, instead distribute The Program under a different license You may use the parts of the text of LPPL as a model for your own license, but your license should not directly refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that The Program is distributed under the LPPL. The LaTeX Project Public License ================================ Terms And Conditions For Copying, Distribution And Modification =============================================================== WARRANTY ======== There is no warranty for The Program, to the extent permitted by applicable law Except when otherwise stated in writing, The Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is' without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you Should The Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

DISTRIBUTION ============ Redistribution of unchanged files is allowed provided that all files that make up the distribution of The Program are distributed In particular this means that The Program has to be distributed including its documentation if documentation was part of the original distribution. The distribution of The Program will contain a prominent file listing all the files covered by this license. If you receive only some of these files from someone, complain! The distribution of changed versions of certain files included in the The Program, and the reuse of code from The Program, are allowed under the following restrictions: * It is allowed only if the legal notice in the file does not expressly forbid it See note below, under "Conditions on individual files". * You rename the file before you make any changes to it, unless the file explicitly says that renaming is not required
