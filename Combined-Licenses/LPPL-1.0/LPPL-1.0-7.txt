LaTeX Project Public License LPPL Version 1.0 1999-03-01 Copyright 1999 LaTeX3 Project Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but modification is not allowed. Preamble The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the license under which the base LaTeX distribution is distributed As described below you may use this licence for any software that you wish to distribute. It may be particularly suitable if your software is TeX related (such as a LaTeX package file) but it may be used for any software, even if it is unrelated to TeX. To use this license, the files of your distribution should have an explicit copyright notice giving your name and the year, together with a reference to this license. A typical example would be %% pig.sty %% Copyright 2001 M Y Name % This program can redistributed and/or modified under the terms % of the LaTeX Project Public License Distributed from CTAN % archives in directory macros/latex/base/lppl.txt; either % version 1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. Given such a notice in the file, the conditions of this document would apply, with: `The Program' referring to the software `pig.sty' and `The Copyright Holder' referring to the person `M Y Name'. To see a real example, see the file legal.txt which carries the copyright notice for the base latex distribution. This license gives terms under which files of The Program may be distributed and modified Individual files may have specific further constraints on modification, but no file should have restrictions on distribution other than those specified below. This is to ensure that a distributor wishing to distribute a complete unmodified copy of The Program need only check the conditions in this file, and does not need to check every file in The Program for extra restrictions If you do need to modify the distribution terms of some files, do not refer to this license, instead distribute The Program under a different license You may use the parts of the text of LPPL as a model for your own license, but your license should not directly refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that The Program is distributed under the LPPL.
