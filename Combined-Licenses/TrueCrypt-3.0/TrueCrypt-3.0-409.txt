4. "Your Product" means This Product modified by You, or any work You derive from (or base on) any part of This Product. In addition, "Your Product" means any work in which You include any (modified or unmodified) portion of This Product. However, if the work in which you include it is an aggregate software distribution (such as an operating system distribution or a cover CD-ROM of a magazine) containing multiple separate products, then the term "Your Product" includes only those products (in the aggregate software distribution) that use, include, or depend on a modified or unmodified version of This Product (and the term "Your Product" does not include the whole aggregate software distribution). For the purposes of this License, a product suite consisting of two or more products is considered a single product (operating system distributions and cover media of magazines are not considered product suites).
