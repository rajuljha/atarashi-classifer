This FLOSS Exception applies to all Programs that contain a notice placed by Alfresco Software, Ltd. saying that the Program may be distributed under the terms of this FLOSS Exception. If you create or distribute a work which is a Derivative Work of both the Program and any other work licensed under the GPL, then this FLOSS Exception is not available for that work; thus, you must remove the FLOSS Exception notice from that work and comply with the GPL in all respects, including by retaining all GPL notices. You may choose to redistribute a copy of the Program exclusively under the terms of the GPL by removing the FLOSS Exception notice from that copy of the Program, provided that the copy has never been modified by you or any third party.
