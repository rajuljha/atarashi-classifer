2.2  You may display the Logo only in the form and at the size provided to you.  You may not modify or alter the Logo or Code in any way, including size, proportions, colors, elements, type or any other respect.  You may not animate, morph or otherwise distort the Logo's perspective or dimensional appearance, nor may you use screen shots of your pages (to the extent that the Logo appears in the screen shot) in any other medium (except as permitted by Section 1(b)).  If Epinions provides you with a substitute version of the Logo, you shall replace the Logo as soon as reasonably possible.
