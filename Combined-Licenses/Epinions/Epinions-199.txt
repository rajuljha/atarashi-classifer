7.  General.  This Agreement is governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California between California residents.  Both parties submit to personal jurisdiction in California and further agree that any cause of action arising under this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in a court in San Mateo County, California.  Epinions shall be excused for any failure to perform to the extent that its performance is prevented by any reason outside of its control.  No agency, partnership, joint venture, employment or franchise relationship is intended or created by this Agreement.  If any portion of this Agreement is deemed unenforceable, that portion shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible and the remaining portions of the Agreement shall be given full effect.  Epinions' failure to act in a particular circumstance does not waive the ability to act with respect to that circumstance or similar circumstances.\r\n
