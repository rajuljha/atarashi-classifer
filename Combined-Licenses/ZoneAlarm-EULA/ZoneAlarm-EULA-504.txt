8. WARRANTY:\r\n8.1 Limited Warranty. ZoneAlarm warrants to You that the encoding of the Software on the media \r\non which the Software is furnished will be free from defects in material and workmanship, and \r\nthat the Software shall substantially conform to its user manual, as it exists at the date of \r\ndelivery, for a period of ninety (90) days from the date You receive the original License Key. \r\nZoneAlarm's entire liability and Your exclusive remedy shall be, at ZoneAlarm's option, either: \r\n(i) return of the price paid to ZoneAlarm for the Software, resulting in the termination of \r\nthis Agreement, or (ii) repair or replacement of the Software or media that does not meet this \r\nlimited warranty. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or \r\nlimitations on how long an implied warranty may last, so the above limitations may not apply \r\nto You. This warranty gives You specific legal rights. You may have other rights that vary \r\nfrom state to state.
