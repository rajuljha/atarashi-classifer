No Access To Emergency Services: Skype is not a replacement for Your ordinary mobile or fixed line telephone. In particular, apart from in the very limited circumstances set out in paragraph 3.5 of the Terms of Service, Skype does not allow You to make emergency calls to emergency services. You must make alternative communications arrangements to ensure that You can make emergency calls if needed.  Please also see paragraphs 3.6 and 6.2 below.
