Intel wireless LAN adapters are engineered, manufactured, tested, and quality checked to ensure that they meet all necessary local and governmental regulatory agency requirements for the regions that they are designated and/or marked to ship into Since wireless LANs are generally unlicensed devices that share spectrum with radars, satellites, and other licensed and unlicensed devices, it is sometimes necessary to dynamically detect, avoid, and limit usage to avoid interference with these devices In many instances Intel is required to provide test data to prove regional and local compliance to regional and governmental regulations before certification or approval to use the product is granted Intel's wireless LAN's EEPROM, firmware, microcode, and software driver are designed to carefully control parameters that affect radio operation and to ensure electromagnetic compliance (EMC) These parameters include, without limitation, RF power, spectrum usage, channel scanning, and human exposure. For these reasons Intel cannot permit any manipulation by third parties of the software provided in binary format with the wireless WLAN adapters (e.g., the EEPROM, regulatory daemon, and microcode)
