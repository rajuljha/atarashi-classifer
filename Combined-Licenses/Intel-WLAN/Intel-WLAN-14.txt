Intel wireless LAN adapters are engineered, manufactured, tested, and\r\nquality checked to ensure that they meet all necessary local and\r\ngovernmental regulatory agency requirements for the regions that they\r\nare designated and/or marked to ship into. Since wireless LANs are\r\ngenerally unlicensed devices that share spectrum with radars,\r\nsatellites, and other licensed and unlicensed devices, it is sometimes\r\nnecessary to dynamically detect, avoid, and limit usage to avoid\r\ninterference with these devices. In many instances Intel is required to\r\nprovide test data to prove regional and local compliance to regional and\r\ngovernmental regulations before certification or approval to use the\r\nproduct is granted. Intel's wireless LAN's EEPROM, firmware, \r\nmicrocode, and software driver are designed to carefully control \r\nparameters that affect radio operation and to ensure electromagnetic \r\ncompliance (EMC). These parameters include, without limitation, RF \r\npower, spectrum usage, channel scanning, and human exposure.
