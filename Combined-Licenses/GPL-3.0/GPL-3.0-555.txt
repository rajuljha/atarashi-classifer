  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express\r\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\r\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\r\nsue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a\r\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\r\npatent against the party.
