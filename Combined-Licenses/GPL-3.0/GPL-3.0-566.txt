  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\r\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\r\nPublic License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the\r\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\r\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\r\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\r\nby the Free Software Foundation.
