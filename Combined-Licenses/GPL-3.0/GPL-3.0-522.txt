  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any\r\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\r\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\r\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\r\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\r\nproduct received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a\r\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\r\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\r\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\r\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\r\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\r\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.
