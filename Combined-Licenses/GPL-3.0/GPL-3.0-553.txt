  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims\r\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\r\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\r\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\r\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\r\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\r\npurposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant\r\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\r\nthis License.
