6.2.2\tIf Client or Red Hat materially breaches the terms of an Order Form, and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice of the breach is given to the breaching party, then the other party may, by giving written notice of termination to the breaching party, terminate the applicable Order Form and/or this Agreement; provided, however, that no cure period will be required for a breach of Section 9 of this Agreement. The termination of an individual Order Form will not terminate any other Order Form or this Agreement unless otherwise specified in the written notice of termination. Without prejudice to any other right or remedy of Red Hat, in the event either party terminates an Order Form, Client will pay Red Hat (or the Business Partner from whom Client purchased such Software or Services) for all Services provided up to the effective date of termination.
