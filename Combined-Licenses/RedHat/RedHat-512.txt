3.2\tInvoices\r\n3.2.1 If Client desires credit terms with respect to the payment of Fees, Client will reasonably cooperate with Red Hat in establishing and periodically re-confirming Client's credit-worthiness. If credit terms are provided to Client, Red Hat will invoice Client for the Fees upon Red Hat's acceptance of the applicable Order Form and upon acceptance of any future order. Unless otherwise specified in an Order Form and subject to Red Hat's approval of credit terms, Client will pay Fees and expenses, if any, no later than thirty (30) days from the date of each invoice; provided, however, that Fees for professional services, training, training credits and other service credits are due prior to delivery. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all payments made by Client pursuant to this Agreement are non-refundable. Red Hat reserves the right to suspend or cancel performance of all or part of the Services and/or change its credit terms if actual payment has not been received within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.
