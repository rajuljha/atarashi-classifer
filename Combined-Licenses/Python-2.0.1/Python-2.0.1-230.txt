Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\r\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor of a\r\nlanguage called ABC.  Guido is Python's principal author, although it\r\nincludes many contributions from others.  The last version released\r\nfrom CWI was Python 1.2.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python\r\nat the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston,\r\nVirginia where he released several versions of the software.  Python\r\n1.6 was the last of the versions released by CNRI.  In 2000, Guido and\r\nthe Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the\r\nBeOpen PythonLabs team.  Python 2.0 was the first and only release\r\nfrom BeOpen.com.
