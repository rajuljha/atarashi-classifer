"Documentation" means schematic diagrams, designs, circuit or circuit board layouts, mechanical drawings, flow charts and descriptive text, and other explanatory material that is explicitly stated as being made available under the conditions of this Licence The Documentation may be in any medium, including but not limited to computer files and representations on paper, film, or any other media. "Documentation Location" means a location where the Licensor has placed Documentation, and which he believes will be publicly accessible for at least three years from the first communication to the public or distribution of Documentation. "Product" means either an entire, or any part of a, device built using the Documentation or the modified Documentation.
