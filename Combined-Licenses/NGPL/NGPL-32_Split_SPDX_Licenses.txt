NETHACK GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (Copyright 1989 M Stephenson) (Based on the BISON general public license, copyright 1988 Richard M Stallman) Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license, but changing it is not allowed You can also use this wording to make the terms for other programs. The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy of those companies By contrast, our general public license is intended to give everyone the right to share NetHack To make sure that you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights Hence this license agreement. Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away copies of NetHack, that you receive source code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change NetHack or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to deprive anyone else of these rights For example, if you distribute copies of NetHack, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code And you must tell them their rights. Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out that there is no warranty for NetHack If NetHack is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not what we distributed. Therefore we (Mike Stephenson and other holders of NetHack copyrights) make the following terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or change NetHack. COPYING POLICIES 1 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of NetHack source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you keep intact the notices on all files that refer to copyrights, to this License Agreement, and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the NetHack program a copy of this License Agreement along with the program. 2
