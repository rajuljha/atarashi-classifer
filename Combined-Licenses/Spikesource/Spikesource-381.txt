The Terms constitute the entire agreement between each user and SpikeSource and govern each user's use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements. Each user may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when that user uses affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software. The Terms and the relationship between each user and SpikeSource shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions, and each party shall submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect.
