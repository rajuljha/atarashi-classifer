If required by SpikeSource, each user must: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information on the Service's registration form (collectively, the "Registration Data"), and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data as necessary. If, after investigation, we have reasonable grounds to suspect that any user's information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate that user's account and prohibit any and all current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof) by that user other than as expressly provided herein.
