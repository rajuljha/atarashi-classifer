Upon receipt of a proper counter notification under the DMCA, SpikeSource will promptly provide the person who provided the initial notification of claimed infringement with a copy of the counter notification, and inform that person that it will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it in ten business days. Additionally, SpikeSource will replace the removed material and cease disabling access to it not less than ten, nor more than fourteen business days following receipt of the counter notice, unless SpikeSource's designated agent first receives notice from the person who submitted the initial notification that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the subscriber from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the SpikeSource.com or developer.spikesource.com system or network.
