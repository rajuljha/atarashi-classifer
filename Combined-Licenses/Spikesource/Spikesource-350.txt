In the event that you have a dispute with one or more SpikeSource.com or developer.spikesource.com users, you release SpikeSource (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, parent corporation, joint ventures and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code \xc2\xa71542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."
