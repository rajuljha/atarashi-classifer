As such, it allows licensees and sublicensees of Oracle's GPL2\r\nOpenJDK Code to build an executable that includes those\r\nportions of necessary code that Oracle could not provide under\r\nGPL2 (or that Oracle has provided under GPL2 with the Classpath\r\nexception). If you modify or add to the OpenJDK code, that new\r\nGPL2 code may still be combined with Designated Exception\r\nModules if the new code is made subject to this exception by\r\nits copyright holder.\r\n
