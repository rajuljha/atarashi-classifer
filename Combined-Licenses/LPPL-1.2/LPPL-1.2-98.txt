The LaTeX Project Public License =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- LPPL Version 1.2 1999-09-03 Copyright 1999 LaTeX3 Project Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but modification of it is not allowed. PREAMBLE ======== The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the license under which the base LaTeX distribution is distributed. You may use this license for any program that you have written and wish to distribute This license may be particularly suitable if your program is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it even if your program is unrelated to TeX The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE', below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license. In this license document, `The Program' refers to any program distributed under this license. This license gives conditions under which The Program may be distributed and conditions under which modified versions of The Program may be distributed Individual files of The Program may bear supplementary and/or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the distribution of modified versions of themselves, but *no* file of The Program may bear supplementary or superseding conditions on the distribution of an unmodified copy of the file A distributor wishing to distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program therefore needs to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else. Activities other than distribution and/or modification of The Program are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope In particular, the act of running The Program is not restricted. We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of The Program that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of The Program
