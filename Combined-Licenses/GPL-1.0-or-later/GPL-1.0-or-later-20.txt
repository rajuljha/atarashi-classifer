Preamble The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy of those companies By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users The General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it You can use it for your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code
