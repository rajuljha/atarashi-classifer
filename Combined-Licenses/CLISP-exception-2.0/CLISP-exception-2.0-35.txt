You may copy and distribute memory image files generated by the function SAVEINITMEM, if it was generated only from CLISP and independent work, and provided that you accompany them, in the sense of section 3 of the GNU GPL, with the source code of CLISP - precisely the same CLISP version that was used to build the memory image -, the source or compiled code of the user programs needed to rebuild the memory image (source code for all the parts that are not independent work, see above), and a precise description how to rebuild the memory image from these.
