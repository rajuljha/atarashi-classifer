In addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested from and strongly recommended of redistributors that:\r\nIf you are distributing Open Publication works on hardcopy or CD-ROM, you provide email notification to the authors of your intent to redistribute at least thirty days before your manuscript or media freeze, to give the authors time to provide updated documents. This notification should describe modifications, if any, made to the document.\r\nAll substantive modifications (including deletions) be either clearly marked up in the document or else described in an attachment to the document.\r\nFinally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is considered good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy and CD-ROM expression of an Open Publication-licensed work to its author(s).
