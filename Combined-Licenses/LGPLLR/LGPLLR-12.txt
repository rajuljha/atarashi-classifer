Lesser General Public License For Linguistic Resources Preamble The licenses for most data are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it By contrast, this License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free data--to make sure the data are free for all their users. This License, the Lesser General Public License for Linguistic Resources, applies to some specially designated linguistic resources -- typically lexicons and grammars. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0 This License Agreement applies to any Linguistic Resource which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License for Linguistic Resources (also called "this License") Each licensee is addressed as "you". A "linguistic resource" means a collection of data about language prepared so as to be used with application programs. The "Linguistic Resource", below, refers to any such work which has been distributed under these terms A "work based on the Linguistic Resource" means either the Linguistic Resource or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Linguistic Resource or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) "Legible form" for a linguistic resource means the preferred form of the resource for making modifications to it. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope The act of running a program using the Linguistic Resource is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Linguistic Resource (independent of the use of the Linguistic Resource in a tool for writing it) Whether that is true depends on what the program that uses the Linguistic Resource does. 1 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Linguistic Resource as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Linguistic Resource. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2 You may modify your copy or copies of the Linguistic Resource or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Linguistic Resource, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a linguistic resource. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Linguistic Resource, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Linguistic Resource, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Linguistic Resource. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Linguistic Resource with the Linguistic Resource (or with a work based on the Linguistic Resource) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3 A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Linguistic Resource, but is designed to work with the Linguistic Resource (or an encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource) by reading it or being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Linguistic Resource" Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Linguistic Resource, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, combining a "work that uses the Linguistic Resource" with the Linguistic Resource (or an encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource) creates a package that is a derivative of the Linguistic Resource (because it contains portions of the Linguistic Resource), rather than a "work that uses the Linguistic Resource" If the package is a derivative of the Linguistic Resource, you may distribute the package under the terms of Section 4 Any works containing that package also fall under Section 4. 4 As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine a "work that uses the Linguistic Resource" with the Linguistic Resource (or an encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource) to produce a package containing portions of the Linguistic Resource, and distribute that package under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the package for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the package that the Linguistic Resource is used in it and that the Linguistic Resource and its use are covered by this License You must supply a copy of this License If the package during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Linguistic Resource among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License Also, you must do one of these things: a) Accompany the package with the complete corresponding machine-readable legible form of the Linguistic Resource including whatever changes were used in the package (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the package contains an encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Linguistic Resource", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Linguistic Resource and then encrypt it to produce a modified package containing the modified Linguistic Resource. b) Use a suitable mechanism for combining with the Linguistic Resource A suitable mechanism is one that will operate properly with a modified version of the Linguistic Resource, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the package was made with. c) Accompany the package with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 4a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. d) If distribution of the package is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. If the package includes an encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource, the required form of the "work that uses the Linguistic Resource" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the package from it However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Linguistic Resource together in a package that you distribute. 5 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Linguistic Resource except as expressly provided under this License Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Linguistic Resource is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 6 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Linguistic Resource or its derivative works These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License
