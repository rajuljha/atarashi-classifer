(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under\r\n    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\r\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\r\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\r\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
