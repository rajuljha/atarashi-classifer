Licensee may distribute Executable version(s) of Covered Code to Helix Licensees and other third parties only for the purpose of evaluation and comment in connection with Research Use by Licensee and under a license of Licensee\xe2\x80\x99s choice, but that limits use of such Executable version(s) of Covered Code only to that purpose.\r\n \r\n(iii) Modified Class, Interface and Package Naming.  In connection with Research Use by Licensee only, Licensee may use RN's class, Interface and package names only to accurately reference or invoke the Source Code files that Licensee modifies.  RN grants to Licensee a limited license to the extent necessary for such purposes. \r\n \r\n(e) Extensions. \r\n \r\n(i) Licensee may not include any Source Code of Community Code in any Extensions.  Licensee may include the compiled Header Files of Community Code in an Extension provided that Licensee\xe2\x80\x99s use of the Covered Code, including Header Files, complies with the TCK and all other terms of this License.  \r\n \r\n(ii) Open.  Licensee must refrain from enforcing any Intellectual Property Rights Licensee may have covering any Interface(s) of Licensee\xe2\x80\x99s Extension, which would prevent the implementation of such Interface(s) by RN or any Helix Licensee.  This obligation does not prevent Licensee from enforcing any Intellectual Property Right Licensee has that would otherwise be infringed by an implementation of Licensee\xe2\x80\x99s Extension.\r\n \r\n(iii) Interface Modifications and Naming.  Licensee may not modify or add to the GUID space   "xxxxxxxx-0901-11d1-8B06-00A024406D59" or any other GUID space designated by RN.  Licensee may not modify any Interface prefix provided with the Covered Code or any other prefix designated by RN. \r\n \r\n(f) Any Specifications provided to Licensee by RN are confidential and proprietary information of RN.  Licensee must maintain the confidentiality of the Specifications and may not disclose them to any third party without RN\xe2\x80\x99s prior written consent.  Licensee may only use the Specifications under the terms of this License and only for the purpose of implementing the terms of this License with respect to Community Code.  Licensee may not use, copy or distribute any such Specifications except as provided in writing by RN.\r\n \r\nNo Commercial Use. \r\n \r\nLicensee may not make Commercial Use of any Covered Code unless Licensee and RN have executed a copy of the RCSL - Commercial available at the Helix Community Website, or another license agreement expressly granting commercial use rights.  \r\n \r\n4.  Versions of the License.\r\n \r\n4.1 License Versions.\r\n \r\nRN may publish revised versions of this License from time to time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
