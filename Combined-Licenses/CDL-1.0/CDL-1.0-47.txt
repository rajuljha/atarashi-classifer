(b) An appropriate copyright notice for your Derivative Work must be added adjacent to the other copyright notices. (c) A statement briefly summarizing how your Derivative Work is different from the original Document must be included in the same place as your copyright notice. (d) If it is not reasonably evident to a recipient of your Derivative Work that the Derivative Work is subject to the terms of this License, a statement indicating such fact must be included in the same place as your copyright notice. 4 Compilation with Independent Works You may compile or combine a Document or its Derivative Works with other separate and independent documents or works to create a compilation work ("Compilation") If included in a Compilation, the Document or Derivative Work thereof must still be provided under the terms of this License, and the Compilation shall contain (a) a notice specifying the inclusion of the Document and/or Derivative Work and the fact that it is subject to the terms of this License, and (b) either a copy of the License or an incorporation by reference in proper form (as indicated in Exhibit A) Mere aggregation of a Document or Derivative Work with other documents or works on the same storage or distribution medium (e.g a CD-ROM) will not cause this License to apply to those other works. 5
