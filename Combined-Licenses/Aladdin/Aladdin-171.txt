         (iii) If the Work normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, at each time the Work commences operation, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty). Such notice must also state that users may redistribute the Work only under the conditions of this License and tell the user how to view the copy of this License included with the Work. (Exceptions: if the Program is interactive but normally prints or displays such an announcement only at the request of a user, such as in an "About box", the Work is required to print or display the notice only under the same circumstances; if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, the Work is not required to print an announcement.);
