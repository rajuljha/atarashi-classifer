      5.1 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Licensed Software set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Licensor or any Contributor that the Licensed Software does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Licensor and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Licensed Software, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Licensed Software.
