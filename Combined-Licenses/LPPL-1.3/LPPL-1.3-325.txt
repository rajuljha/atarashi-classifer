9.  Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative\r\nformat, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is\r\nthen produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or\r\nnullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of\r\napplying that process.\r\n     \r\n10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license\r\n       provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in\r\n       Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have\r\n       to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.\r\n      \r\n    b. If a Derived Work is distributed under this license, that\r\n       Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of\r\n       itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the \r\n       restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.
