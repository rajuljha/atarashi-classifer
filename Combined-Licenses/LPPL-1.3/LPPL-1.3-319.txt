  a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement\r\n     for a component of the Work when that component is used with the\r\n     Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work\r\n     identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that\r\n     Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work\r\n     clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version\r\n     of this component to the user when used interactively with that\r\n     Base Interpreter.\r\n     \r\n  b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices\r\n     detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a\r\n     prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part\r\n     of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log\r\n     of the changes.\r\n  \r\n  c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,\r\n     including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version\r\n     of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)\r\n     the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the\r\n     Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that\r\n     they do provide such support for the Derived Work.
