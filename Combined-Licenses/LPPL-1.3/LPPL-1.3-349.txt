It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own\r\npersonal use, without also meeting the above conditions for\r\ndistributing the modified component.  While you might intend that such\r\nmodifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by\r\naccident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or\r\nit may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified\r\nversion that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions\r\nof this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,\r\ncause problems for the community.  It is therefore usually in your\r\nbest interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public\r\none.  Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work\r\nwithout altering any of its licensed components.
