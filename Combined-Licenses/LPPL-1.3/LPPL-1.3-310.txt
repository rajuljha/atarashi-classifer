   `Base Interpreter' \r\n    A program or process that is normally needed for running or\r\n    interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.    \r\n    A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these\r\n    are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each\r\n    external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used\r\n    interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the\r\n    license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a\r\n    "LaTeX-Format".
