This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1 APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you" You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections
