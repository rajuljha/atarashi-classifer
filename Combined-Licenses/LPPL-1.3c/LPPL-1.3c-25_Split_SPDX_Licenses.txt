The LaTeX Project Public License =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- LPPL Version 1.3c 2008-05-04 Copyright 1999 2002-2008 LaTeX3 Project Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but modification of it is not allowed. PREAMBLE ======== The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under which the LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed. You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright and which you wish to distribute This license may be particularly suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but it is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is unrelated to TeX. The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE', below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license. This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of that work may be distributed. We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of that work If you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex' and `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions. DEFINITIONS =========== In this license document the following terms are used: `Work' Any work being distributed under this License `Derived Work' Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work. `Modification' Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law -- for example, the production of a file containing an original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. `Modify' To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law `Distribution' Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in whole or in part Distribution includes (but is not limited to) making any electronic components of the Work accessible by file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS). `Compiled Work' A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it is directly usable on a computer system This processing may include using installation facilities provided by the Work, transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or other activities Note that modification of any installation facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work. `Current Maintainer' A person or persons nominated as such within the Work If there is no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under any applicable law. `Base Interpreter' A program or process that is normally needed for running or interpreting a part or the whole of the Work. A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used interactively Unless explicitly specified when applying the license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the `LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX language'. CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION =========================================== 1 Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope In particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work. 2 You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you received it Distribution of only part of the Work is considered modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause. 3
