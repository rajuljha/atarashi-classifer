The Open Group Test Suite License Preamble The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications. Testing is essential for proper development and maintenance of standards-based products. For buyers: adequate conformance testing leads to reduced integration costs and protection of investments in applications, software and people. For software developers: conformance testing of platforms and middleware greatly reduces the cost of developing and maintaining multi-platform application software. For suppliers: In-depth testing increases customer satisfaction and keeps development and support costs in check API conformance is highly measurable and suppliers who claim it must be able to substantiate that claim. As such, since these are benchmark measures of conformance, we feel the integrity of test tools is of importance In order to preserve the integrity of the existing conformance modes of this test package and to permit recipients of modified versions of this package to run the original test modes, this license requires that the original test modes be preserved. If you find a bug in one of the standards mode test cases, please let us know so we can feed this back into the original, and also raise any specification issues with the appropriate bodies (for example the POSIX committees). Definitions: "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification. "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder. "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package. "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package. "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on
