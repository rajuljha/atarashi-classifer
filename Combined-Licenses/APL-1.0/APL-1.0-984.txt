      E. If Recipient institutes patent litigation against another Recipient (a "USER") with respect to a patent applicable to a computer program or software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit, and whether or not any of the patent claims are directed to a system, method, process, apparatus, device, product, article of manufacture or any other form of patent claim), then any patent or copyright license granted by that User to such Recipient under this License or any other copy of this License shall terminate. The termination shall be effective ninety (90) days after notice of termination from User to Recipient, unless the Recipient withdraws the patent litigation claim before the end of the ninety (90) day period. To be effective, any such notice of license termination must include a specific list of applicable patents and/or a copy of the copyrighted work of User that User alleges will be infringed by Recipient upon License termination. License termination is only effective with respect to patents and/or copyrights for which proper notice has been given.
