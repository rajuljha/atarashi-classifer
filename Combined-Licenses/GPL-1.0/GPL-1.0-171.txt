Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\r\nspecifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any\r\nlater version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\r\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\r\nthe license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.
