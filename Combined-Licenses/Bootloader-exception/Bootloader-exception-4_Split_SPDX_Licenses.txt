In addition to the permissions in the GNU General Public License, the\r\nauthors give you unlimited permission to link or embed compiled bootloader\r\nand related files into combinations with other programs, and to distribute\r\nthose combinations without any restriction coming from the use of those\r\nfiles. (The General Public License restrictions do apply in other respects;\r\nfor example, they cover modification of the files, and distribution when\r\nnot linked into a combine executable.)\r\n
