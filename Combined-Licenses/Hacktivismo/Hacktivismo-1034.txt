The licenses for most computer software programs are designed to take away Your freedom to share software or change source code. This kind of software is designated as proprietary or "closed." The Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement -- like other license agreements that have served as inspiration for our work -- is intended to promote both Your freedom to share our software with others, and Your freedom to change and improve the software. Your right under this License Agreement to look at the source not only enables You to contribute Your own efforts to Hacktivismo's human rights projects, but also serves as an additional level of assurance to You as an end-user that unwelcome, hidden surprises have not been inserted into the software, that could compromise Your rights and freedoms when You use the software.
