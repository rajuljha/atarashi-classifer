14.3\tAny Governmental Entity that uses, copies, changes, modifies, displays, performs, or distributes the Software or any part thereof, or any Governmental Person who does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), and thereby violates any terms and conditions of Section 9 (restrictions on modification), or Paragraph 10 (use restrictions), agrees that the person or entity is subject not only to an action by the Author, for the enforcement of this License Agreement and for money damages and injunctive relief (as well as attorneys' fees, additional and statutory damages, and other remedies as provided by law), but such Governmental Entity and/or Person also shall be subject to a suit for money damages and injunctive relief by any person whose human rights have been violated or infringed, in violation of this License Agreement, or through the use of any Software in violation of this License Agreement. Any person who brings an action under this section against any Governmental Person or Entity must notify the Author promptly of the action and provide the Author the opportunity to intervene to assert the Author's own rights. Damages in such a third-party action shall be measured by the severity of the human rights violation and the copyright infringement or License Agreement violation, combined, and not merely by reference to the copyright infringement. All end-users, to the extent that they are entitled to bring suit against such Governmental Entity by way of this License Agreement, are intended third-party beneficiaries of this License Agreement. Punitive damages may be awarded in such a third-party action against a Governmental Entity or Governmental Person, and each and every such Governmental Entity or Person conclusively waives all restrictions on the amount of punitive damages, and all defenses to the award of punitive damages to the extend such limitations or defenses depend upon or are a function of such person or entity's status as a Governmental Person or Governmental Entity.
