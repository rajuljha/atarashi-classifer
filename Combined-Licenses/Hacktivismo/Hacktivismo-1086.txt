0.12.3\tIn other words, Your key-generation technique must promote security to the maximum extent permitted by the cryptographic method(s) and keylength You elect to employ, rather than facilitating eavesdropping or surveillance in any way. The example of GSM telephones, in which 16 of 56 bits in each encryption key were set at "0," thereby reducing the security of the system by a factor of 65,536, is particularly salient. Such artificial techniques to reduce the security of a cryptosystem by selecting keys from only a less-secure or suboptimal subset of possible keys, is prohibited and will violate this License Agreement if any such technique is employed in any Software.
