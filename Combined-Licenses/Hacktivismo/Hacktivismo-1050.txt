Compared with the GPL, aspects of the HESSLA give both end-users and programmers (including, most importantly, governmental end-users and programmers) marginally less leeway to make malicious use of the program, or to insert malicious code into a program, than they would have under a traditional "copyleft" software license. These aspects of the HESSLA (such as the requirement that the program cannot be used to violate human rights, or forbidding the insertion of "spy-ware" or surveillance mechanisms into derivative works) are included because our ultimate objective is to preserve and promote the human rights of end-users, including their privacy and their right of free expression.
