A "copy" does not become anything other than a "copy" merely because, for example, a governmental or institutional employee duplicates the Program or a part of it for another employee of the same institution or Governmental Entity, or merely because it is copied from one computer to another, or from one medium to another, or multiple copies are made on the same medium, within the same institutional or Governmental Entity.
