9.6 No Program or Software copied or distributed by You may transmit or communicate any symmetric key, any "private key" if an asymmetric cryptosystem is employed, or any part of such key, nor may it otherwise make any such key or part of such key known, to any person other than the end-user who generated the key, without the active consent and participation of that individual end-user. If a private or symmetric key is stored or recorded in any manner, it must not be stored or recorded in plaintext, and it must be protected from reading (at a minimum) by use of a password. Use of steganography or other techniques to disguise the fact that a private or symmetric key is even stored is strongly encouraged, but not absolutely required.
