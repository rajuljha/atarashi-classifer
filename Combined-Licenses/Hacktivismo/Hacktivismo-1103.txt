5.1\tSource Code Always Available from Author: Author hereby promises and agrees except to the extent prohibited by export-control law to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Program at the request of any Licensee. Author reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the most current version of the Program in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for so long as Author continues to distribute the Program, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Program. Every copy of the Program distributed by Hacktivismo (but not necessarily every other Author) consists of the Source Code accompanied, in some instances, by an ancillary distribution of compiled Object Code, but the continued availability of the Source Code from the Author addresses the possibility that You might have (for any reason) not received from someone else a complete, current, copy of the Source Code (lack of which would, for example, prevent You from exporting copies to others without violating this license, see Section 8).
