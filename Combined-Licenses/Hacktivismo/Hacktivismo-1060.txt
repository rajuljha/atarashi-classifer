Anyone Can Release Original Software Under The HESSLA: Although this License Agreement is drafted with Hacktivismo's objectives in mind, perhaps it will meet other authors' needs as well. If You are considering using this License Agreement for Your own software (meaning the code is not a work based on Hacktivismo's program in which case all derivative works must be released under this License Agreement but rather Your code is original software that You have developed yourself) and if You have no special reason to prefer this License Agreement to some license that has a more robust and widely-understood track-record, then in most instances we encourage You to use the GPL (or, even better, release concurrently under both the HESSLA and the GPL), because a considerable body of interpretive literature and community custom has grown up around that License Agreement. The Open Software License, see < http://www.rosenlaw.com/osl.html >, is newer and has less of a track record. But You may also want to consider that licensing option (as well as the option of concurrent OSL/HESSLA licensing).
