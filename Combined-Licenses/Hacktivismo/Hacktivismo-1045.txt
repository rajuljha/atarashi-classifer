In this regard, the methodology we employ is not materially different from the methodology Free Software Foundation employs in the GNU General Public License (the "GPL"). The methodology is to exchange the Author's permission to copy, change, and/or distribute a copyrighted work, for every Licensee's acceptance of terms and conditions that promote the licensor's objectives. In both this License Agreement and the GPL, the terms and conditions that each Licensee must accept are intended to discriminate against certain very narrow, limited kinds of human endeavor, that are inconsistent with the licensor's political objectives. In other words, the GPL requires each Licensee to promise not to engage in the activity of 'propertizing,' or 'taking proprietary,' modifications to GPLed code; modified code must also be released under the GPL, and cannot be released in the form of "closed" executables, or otherwise be made "proprietary." Likewise, the Hacktivismo Enhanced Source Software License Agreement discriminates against undesirable activity such as surveillance, introduction of certain kinds of malicious code, and human rights violations, as well as discriminating against "propertizing" behavior such as might violate the GPL. Subject to these narrow restrictions, Licensees under either license agreement enjoy very broad latitude to change, use, explore, modify, and distribute the software much broader than they would enjoy with typical "proprietary" software packages.
