Ultimately, we think it is important to emphasize to other Authors that Programs they have written can be released under both the HESSLA and some other license simultaneously (for, example, a program that is presently GPLed by its Author can be released simultaneously under both the GPL and the HESSLA, at the Author's discretion). If You are an Author of original work, You need neither the permission of the Free Software Foundation nor of Hacktivismo to elect to release software simultaneously under both licenses. The advantage of such a voluntary double-licensing is that it will enable developers to produce hybrid software packages (combining the functionality available through, say, Hacktivismo's Six-Four APIs, with some of the functionality of one or more popular GPL-licensed communications programs) and to release the hybrid packages under the HESSLA, without causing those developers to run afoul of the GPL, the HESSLA or both. Such an arrangement maximizes the potential benefit to both the developer community and to end-users worldwide. Software released under a BSD-style license, as a general matter, can be used to produce a hybrid program, mixing HESSLA-licensed code with code that was previously subject to a BSD license. The HESSLA requires that, in such an instance, the hybrid code must be released under the HESSLA (to avoid weakening the end-user protections and affirmative rights afforded by the HESSLA). Hacktivismo is more than happy to consult with any software developer about the license terms that should apply to any Software that is derivative of any Program of which Hacktivismo is Author. If another Author has released code under the HESSLA, then that Author has primary decision-making authority about the manner in which his her or its software is licensed, but Hacktivismo is happy to field any questions hat may be posed by such an Author or by any developer who is building on another Author's HESSLAed code.
