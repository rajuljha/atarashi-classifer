As with "copyleft" licenses such as the GPL, under the Hacktivismo Enhanced Source Software License Agreement, programmers (including, most importantly, programmers working for governments) do not have unfettered or completely unlimited "freedom" for purposes of what they can do with HESSLA-licensed code. Just as with the GPL, they do not have the "freedom" to convert HESSLA-licensed code into "closed" or "proprietary" code. People who create derivative works based on an HESSLA-licensed program and distribute those works have a corresponding obligation to "give back," and not merely to "take," HESSLA-licensed code.
