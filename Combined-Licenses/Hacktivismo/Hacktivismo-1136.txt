13.\tContrary Judgments, Settlements and Court Orders. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on You (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License Agreement, they do not excuse You from the conditions of this License Agreement. If You cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously Your obligations under this License Agreement and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence You may not distribute the Software at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through You, then the only way You could satisfy both it and this License Agreement would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
