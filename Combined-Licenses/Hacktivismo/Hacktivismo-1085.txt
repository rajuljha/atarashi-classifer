0.12.2\tIf the key-generation or key-selection technique for the encryption algorithm You employ involves the selection of a random integer, or the transformation of a random integer through one or more mathematical processes, then the selection of the integer shall be at random from the largest possible set of all possible integers consistent with the secure functioning of the encryption algorithm. It shall not be selected from an artificially small set of integers (e.g., if a 256-bit random integer serves as the key, then You could not set 200 of the 256 bits as "0," and randomly generate only the remaining 56 bits producing effectively a 56-bit keylength instead of using the full 256 bits).
