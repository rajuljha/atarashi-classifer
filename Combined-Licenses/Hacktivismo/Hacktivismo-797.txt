INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT Software that Hacktivismo[fn1] releases under this License Agreement is intended to promote our political objectives And, likewise, the purpose of this License Agreement itself is political: Namely, to compliment the software's intended political function Hacktivismo itself exists to develop and deploy computer software technologies that promote fundamental human rights of end-users Hacktivismo also seeks to enlist the active participation and involvement of people around the world, to help us improve these software tools, and to take other actions (including actions that involve using and distributing our software, and the advancement of similarly-minded software projects of others) that promote human rights and freedom worldwide. [fn1] http://hacktivismo.com/ Because of our non-commercial objective of promoting end-users' freedoms, Hacktivismo has some special, and admittedly ambitious, licensing needs This License Agreement enhances the benefits of published source code by backing up our human rights projects with appropriate remedies enforceable in court. The Freedoms We Promote: When we speak of the freedom of end-users, we are talking about basic freedoms recognized in the Hacktivismo Declaration,[fn2] the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,[fn3] the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,[fn4] and other documents that recognize and promote freedom and human dignity Principal among these freedoms are: [fn2] http://hacktivismo.com/about/declarations/ [fn3] http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm [fn4] http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html Freedom of Expression: The freedom of opinion and expression "include[s] freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers,"[fn5] and the freedom to choose one's own medium of expression The arbitrary use of technological censorship measures to block or prevent access to broad categories of speech and expression including the work of critics, intellectuals, artists, journalists, and religious figures is seldom, if ever, justified by any legitimate governmental objective And, to the extent that technology enables censorship decisions to be removed from public scrutiny and review, technology-based censorship mechanisms are especially suspect and dangerous to civil society
