14.1 If it is the position of any Governmental Entity (or, in the case of any "Governmental Person," if it is the position of that Governmental Person's Governmental Entity) that any doctrine or doctrines of law (including, without limitation, any doctrine(s) of immunity or any formalities of contract formation) may render this License Agreement unenforceable or less than fully enforceable against such Governmental Entity, or any Governmental Person of such Governmental Entity, then prior to any use, modification, change, display, performance, copy or distribution of the Program, or of any Software or Derivative Work based on the Program, or any part thereof, by the Governmental Entity, or by any Governmental Person of that Governmental Entity, the Governmental Entity shall be required to inform the Author in writing of each such doctrine that is believed to render this License Agreement or any part of it less than fully enforceable against such Governmental Entity or any Governmental Person of such entity, and to explain in reasonable detail what additional steps, if taken, would render the License Agreement fully enforceable against such entity or person. Failure to provide the required written notice to the Author in advance of any such use, modification, change, display, performance, copy or distribution, shall constitute an irrevocable and conclusive waiver of any and all reliance on any doctrine, by the Governmental Entity, that is not included or that is omitted from the required written notice (failure to provide any written notice means all reliance on any doctrine is irrevocably waived). Any Governmental Entity that provides written notice under this subsection is prohibited, as are all of the Governmental Persons of such Governmental Entity, from making any use, change, display, performance, copy, modification or distribution of the Software or any part thereof, until such time as a License Agreement is in place, agreed upon by the Author and by the Governmental Entity, that such entity concedes is fully-enforceable. Any use, modification, change, display, performance, copy, or distribution following written notice under this Paragraph, but without the implementation of an agreement as provided herein, shall constitute an irrevocable and conclusive waiver by the Governmental Entity (and any and all Governmental Persons of such Governmental Entity) of any and all reliance on any legal doctrine either referenced in such written notice or omitted from it.
