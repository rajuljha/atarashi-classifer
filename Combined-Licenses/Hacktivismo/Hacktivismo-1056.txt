Mechanism of Contract Acceptance: This License Agreement treats any use of the software as acceptance of the terms of this License Agreement. To understand the significance of this, it is important to distinguish between the law governing copyright and the law governing offer and acceptance for the purpose of contract formation (which gives the offeror the power to specify the manner of acceptance). The question of whether copyright confers an exclusive right of use on the author of a program is certainly an interesting one. Under United States law, see 17 U.S.C. \x15 117(a)(1), a limited exception to the exclusive right to copy exists if one makes a second copy "created as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine and that it is used in no other manner." This License Agreement presupposes that there is no exclusive right to use in the Copyright Act, just an exclusive right to copy. However, You may not make a copy for anyone else unless they are subject to the terms of this License Agreement. Nor may You permit anyone to use Your copy or any other copy You have made unless they are subject to the terms of this License Agreement. You may not make a copy for Your own use or the use of anyone else without the Author's leave to make that copy. And any use, modification, copying, or distribution by anyone constitutes acceptance of the License Agreement, for purposes of contract law. In other words, the License Agreement is designed so that there is no loophole permitting anyone to claim the ability to use, copy, distribute, or modify the Program or any Software based on it without subjecting themselves voluntarily to its terms.
