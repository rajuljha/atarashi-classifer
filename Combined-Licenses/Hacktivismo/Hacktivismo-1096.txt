2.4\tIt is not the position of Hacktivismo that copyright law confers an exclusive right to use, as opposed to the exclusive right to copy the Software. However, for purposes of contract law, any use of the Software shall be considered to constitute acceptance of this License Agreement. Moreover, all copying is prohibited unless the recipient of a copy has accepted the License Agreement. Because each such recipient Licensee is contractually obligated not to permit anyone to access, use, or secure a copy of the Software, without first accepting the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, use by non-Licensees is effectively prohibited contractually because nobody can obtain a copy of, or access to a copy of, any Software without (1) accepting the License Agreement through use, and (2) triggering some Licensee's obligation to require acceptance as a precondition of copying or access.
