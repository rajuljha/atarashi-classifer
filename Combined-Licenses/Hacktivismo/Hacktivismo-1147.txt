14.5\tAny Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, any State of the United States), that uses, copies, changes, modifies, performs, displays, or distributes the Software or any part thereof, or any of whose Governmental Persons does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), unconditionally and irrevocably waives for purposes of any legal action (i) to enforce this License Agreement, (ii) to remedy infringement of the Author's copyright, or (iii) to invoke any of the third-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section 14.3 any doctrine (such as, but not limited to, the holding in the United States Supreme Court decision of Ex Parte Young) that might purport to limit remedies solely to prospective injunctive relief. Also explicitly and irrevocably waived is any underlying immunity doctrine that would require the recognition of such a limited exception for purposes of remedies. The remedies against such governmental entities and persons shall explicitly include money damages, additional damages, statutory damages, consequential damages, exemplary damages, punitive damages, costs and fees that might otherwise be barred or limited in amount on account of governmental status.
