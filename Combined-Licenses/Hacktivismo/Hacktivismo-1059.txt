Software Patents: Software patents constantly threaten any project such as this one. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a HESSLA-licensed program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have included terms by which any Author must, if it has patented (or licensed a patent covering) any technology embodied in any Program or Software released under this License Agreement, grant all HESSLA Licensees of the Program or Software a royalty-free license of that technology. Any Licensees who release derivative works, as permitted by this License Agreement, are required to grant a royalty-free patent license of any patented technology.
