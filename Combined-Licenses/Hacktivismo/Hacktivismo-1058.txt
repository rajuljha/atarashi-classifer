No Warranty: Next, for each author's protection and our own, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this software. And, if the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
