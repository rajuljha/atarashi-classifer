The "open source" and "Free Software" communities rely principally on voluntary compliance[fn14] with the disclosure provisions of license agreements (although many "free" and "open source" license agreements, such as BSD-style licenses, do not require changed code to be disclosed, and in fact enable modified versions of programs to be "taken proprietary") and on social mechanisms of enforcement, as means to detect, prevent, deter, and remedy abuses.
