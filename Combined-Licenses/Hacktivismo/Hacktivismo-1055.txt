Any use, copying or modification of this software by any governmental official or governmental entity anywhere in the world is a voluntary act, which act the governmental official or entity is free to forego if it does not wish to be bound by this License Agreement. This License Agreement seeks to establish as clearly as possible two important checks on the improper use of government power. First, the voluntary election to use, copy, or modify, this software by any government or governmental official constitutes a waiver of all immunities that might otherwise be asserted, against enforcement of this License Agreement by the Author, or assertion by end-users or others of any human rights laws that may have been violated by a government employing the Software. Second, any such government or governmental official not only subjects itself to enforcement action in its own courts, but also explicitly and voluntarily subjects itself to enforcement action in the courts of other nations that are likely to be more objective, for the purpose of giving effect to the terms of this License Agreement.
