[fn15] There is a modest difference, but it is not large, and mostly philosophical. Some experts on the GPL draw a distinction between a "contract" and a pure "license," by taking the position that a pure "license" does not impose "contractual" conditions on a Licensee only conditions that would otherwise (but for the license) be subsumed within with exclusive rights that the licensor has under copyright law. Thus, the licensor has the right to exclude anyone else from such activities as making copies, making derivative works, publicly performing a work, and other exclusive rights specified by statute. But, concerning the act of "using" a computer software program, in instances in which a copy is not made (or, in the trivial sense that a copy is made only temporarily from a storage medium to memory, to enable software to be "used"), the Free Software Foundation takes the position that United States law, at least, does not confer an exclusive right on the copyright holder (or, as others would argue, the United States statute qualifies the holder's exclusive right to copy),because the U.S. Copyright Act specifically exempts from the exclusive right to make copies, a copy made from (for example) a computer hard drive to volatile memory, in connection with the process of executing computer software. So far as we can determine, the Free Software Foundation does not argue that it is impossible "contractually" to impose conditions on use, as part of the bargain one strikes, when conditionally allowing Licensees to make copies of a program. Rather, for philosophical reasons, the Free Software Foundation voluntarily chooses not to include what it views as "contractual" conditions in the GPL. In this sense, Hactivismo takes the position that the HESSLA is clearly a "contract" and contains "contractual" terms, such that it should not be considered a "pure license," under the nomenclature employed by the Free Software Foundation. However, in our view, precisely because both the HESSLA and the GPL are clearly conditional grants of permission to do things from which the Licensee would otherwise be excluded (i.e., the Licensee must undertake certain obligations in exchange for permission to copy, modify, or distribute, a work), the key point is that the methodology is quite similar.
