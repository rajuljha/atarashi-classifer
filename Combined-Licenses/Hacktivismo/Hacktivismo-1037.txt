Previous Licenses Provide More Limited Protection Against Government and Other Surveillance: No software license agreement that qualifies as "free" or "open source" may contain any restriction as a term of the license agreement that in any way qualifies any Licensee's prerogative (no matter who they are or what their motives may be) to make changes to code. In other words, an "open source" license agreement, to qualify for the "open source" label, may not even contain a term that prohibits the insertion of destructive viruses or "trojan horses" into derivative code. Likewise, no "free" or "open source" license agreement can in any way contain (as a license term) any restriction on the use of software not even a prohibition against unlawful surveillance or other malicious uses of the software.
