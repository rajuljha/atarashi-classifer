0.12.1\tIf the key-generation or key-selection technique for the encryption algorithm You employ involves the selection of one or more prime numbers, or involves one or more mathematical functions or concatenations performed on one or more prime numbers, then each prime number should be selected from a very large set of candidate prime numbers, but not necessarily from the set of all possible prime numbers (e.g., inclusion of the number 1 in the candidate set, for example, may in some instances reduce rather than enhance security), and absolutely not from any artificially small set of candidate primes that makes the guessing of a key easier than would be the case if a secure key-generation technique were employed. In all instances, the primes should be selected at random from among the candidate set. If there is a customary industry standard for maximizing the security associated with the key-generation or key-selection technique for the cryptosystem You select, then (with attention also to the requirements of Section 0.11), You should employ a key-generation or selection technique no less secure than the customary industry standard for secure use of the cryptosystem.
