The Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document You may use content from this license document as source material for your own license agreement, but you may not use the name "Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement ," ("HESSLA") or any confusingly similar name, trademark or service-mark, in connection with any license agreement that is not either (1) a verbatim copy of this License Agreement, or (2) a license agreement that contains only additional terms expressly permitted by The HESSLA. INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT Software that Hacktivismo[fn1] releases under this License Agreement is intended to promote our political objectives And, likewise, the purpose of this License Agreement itself is political: Namely, to compliment the software's intended political function Hacktivismo itself exists to develop and deploy computer software technologies that promote fundamental human rights of end-users Hacktivismo also seeks to enlist the active participation and involvement of people around the world, to help us improve these software tools, and to take other actions (including actions that involve using and distributing our software, and the advancement of similarly-minded software projects of others) that promote human rights and freedom worldwide. [fn1] http://hacktivismo.com/ Because of our non-commercial objective of promoting end-users' freedoms, Hacktivismo has some special, and admittedly ambitious, licensing needs This License Agreement enhances the benefits of published source code by backing up our human rights projects with appropriate remedies enforceable in court. The Freedoms We Promote: When we speak of the freedom of end-users, we are talking about basic freedoms recognized in the Hacktivismo Declaration,[fn2] the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,[fn3] the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,[fn4] and other documents that recognize and promote freedom and human dignity Principal among these freedoms are: [fn2] http://hacktivismo.com/about/declarations/ [fn3] http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm [fn4] http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html Freedom of Expression: The freedom of opinion and expression "include[s] freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers,"[fn5] and the freedom to choose one's own medium of expression The arbitrary use of technological censorship measures to block or prevent access to broad categories of speech and expression including the work of critics, intellectuals, artists, journalists, and religious figures is seldom, if ever, justified by any legitimate governmental objective And, to the extent that technology enables censorship decisions to be removed from public scrutiny and review, technology-based censorship mechanisms are especially suspect and dangerous to civil society When repressive governments and other institutions of power seek to deprive people of this basic freedom, people have the right to secure, employ and deploy the tools necessary to reclaim the freedoms to which they are justifiably entitled. [fn5] Article 19, Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Freedom of Collective Action and Association: People have and should have the "freedom of peaceful assembly and association."[fn6] This freedom includes the right of people to work together to secure constructive change in their personal, economic, and political circumstances When repressive governments or other institutions of power seek to deprive people (including users of the Internet) of their freedoms of voluntary assembly, association, and common enterprise, people have the right to secure, employ and deploy technologies that reclaim the freedoms to which they are justifiably entitled. [fn6] Article 20(1), Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Freedoms of Thought, Conscience, Sexuality, and Religion: People have and should have the freedom of "thought, conscience, and religion."[fn7] This right "includes freedom to change religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others, in public or private, to manifest any religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance, regardless of doctrine."[fn8] Every person, regardless of sex or sexual preference, and with reciprocal respect for the corresponding rights of all others, has and should have the right to determine and choose, freely and without coercion, whether, how and with whom he or she shall fully enjoy the most private and personal aspects of human life, including individual sexuality, reproduction, and fertility Moreover, "[t]he explicit recognition and reaffirmation of the right of all women to control all aspects of their health, in particular their own fertility, is basic to their empowerment."[fn9] When repressive governments and other institutions of power seek to deprive people of these basic freedoms, they have the right to secure, employ and deploy the tools necessary to reclaim the freedoms to which they are justifiably entitled. [fn7] Article 18, Universal Declaration of Human Rights. [fn8] Id. [fn9] Paragraph 17, Beijing Declaration of the Fourth United Nations Conference on Women (Sept 15, 1995). Freedom of Privacy: Every person has the right to be free from "subject[ion] to arbitrary interference with his [or her] privacy, family, home or correspondence"[fn10] -- digitally, or by any other means or methodology This freedom of privacy includes the right to be free from governmental or private surveillance that might interfere with or deter the rightful exercise of any other freedoms of any person In the context of software tools that enable people to reclaim their freedoms, all end-users have and should have the right to secure and use tools that are free from the surreptitious insertion into their software of "backdoors," "spy-ware," escrow mechanisms, or other code or techniques that might promote surveillance, or subvert security (including cryptographic security), confidentiality, anonymity, authenticity and/or trust. [fn10] Article 12, Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Reasons For Enhancing "Free" and "Open-Source" Licensing: Developing a new software license is never a trivial task and this License Agreement has presented special challenges for Hacktivismo Because of our human rights objectives, this License Agreement includes some specific terms and conditions that, as a technical matter, depart from the previously-recognized and established definitions of "free"[fn11] software and "open source"[fn12] software. [fn11] http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html [fn12] http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition_plain.php We have therefore coined the term "enhanced source" to describe this License Agreement because we have sought to combine most of the freedom-promoting benefits of "free" or "open-source" software (including mandatory disclosure of any changes or modifications Licensees make to the source code, whenever they release modified versions of HESSLA-licensed Programs or other Derivative Works), with additional enhanced license and contractual terms that are intended to promote the freedom of end-users The Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement promotes our objectives in an enhanced manner by including contractual terms that empower both Hacktivismo and qualified end-users with greater flexibility and leverage to maintain and recover human rights, through the mechanism of the contract itself including terms that are designed to enhance both our enforcement posture and that of qualified end-users in court. To be sure, Hacktivismo enthusiastically endorses and supports the goals and objectives of the Free Software movement and those of the open source community In particular, we owe a special debt of gratitude to the Free Software Foundation, to the Open Source Initiative, and to many exceedingly talented people who have contributed to Free Software and open source projects and endeavors over the years. Ultimately, however, after reviewing the field of possibilities among previously-existing "open source" and "free" licenses, Hacktivismo has concluded that none of them fully meets our requirements Writing our own License Agreement enables us to pursue our human rights objectives more effectively This licensing endeavor represents a first step toward achieving our objectives, and no doubt informed feedback, scholarship, and learned commentary will enable us to pursue our objectives even more effectively in the future. Benefits That Carry Over From Free Software: Before we explain how an "enhanced source" License Agreement specifically differs from a "free" or "open source" license, we believe it is helpful to explain in greater detail what the principal advantages, and freedom-enhancing aspects, of "free" software are. When we speak of "free software," we refer to important personal freedoms, and not price In addition to terms that are intended to promote the freedoms of Expression, Thought, Collective Action and Privacy (along with other human rights) of all end-users, the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement is also designed and intended to promote the following freedoms: \xc2\xb7\tYou have the freedom to distribute copies of the software (and charge for this service if You wish); \xc2\xb7\tYou have the freedom of access to the source code, to inspect and verify (and even to improve, if You can) the integrity and functionality of the software; \xc2\xb7\tSo long as You do not subvert or infringe the freedoms of end-users by doing so, You have the freedom to change the software or to use parts of it in new Programs; \xc2\xb7\tYou have the freedom to know You can do these things. The licenses for most computer software programs are designed to take away Your freedom to share software or change source code This kind of software is designated as proprietary or "closed." The Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement -- like other license agreements that have served as inspiration for our work -- is intended to promote both Your freedom to share our software with others, and Your freedom to change and improve the software Your right under this License Agreement to look at the source not only enables You to contribute Your own efforts to Hacktivismo's human rights projects, but also serves as an additional level of assurance to You as an end-user that unwelcome, hidden surprises have not been inserted into the software, that could compromise Your rights and freedoms when You use the software. HESSLA Helps Safeguard Additional End-User Freedoms: In order to understand why this License Agreement must be described as "enhanced source," and cannot strictly speaking be considered either a "free" or "open source" license agreement, it is helpful to consider the possibility that a programmer might insert malicious code, such as a computer virus, a keystroke logger, or "spyware" into a program that has previously been released under a "free software" license agreement.[fn13] The act of inserting malicious code into software, if done by a private individual or company (though many governments will contend they are not required to play by the same rules as the rest of us), may well violate criminal laws and result in civil tort liability It is, of course, also possible to deter such malicious behavior by including, in a software license agreement, a specific contractual term that prohibits such behavior meaning that any licensee who violates the prohibition against malicious code can be sued by the licensor (or by third-party beneficiaries who the licensor has explicitly identified as alternate or additional enforcers of the agreement) for money damages and a court order forbidding any continued violation. [fn13]In this regard, a the following hypothetical illustration should be particularly helpful If an organization of computer security enthusiasts were to release, under the GNU General Public License ("GPL"), a program called "Grey Eminence 3000" ("GE3K") a remote-administration tool for Microsoft Windows, that helps illustrate how insecure this particular commercial product happens to be it should hardly be surprising that the United States Secret Service and Federal Bureau of Investigation, after making some loud and misleading apocalyptic noises about "computer hackers" to Congress and in the media (primarily in a largely successful effort to increase their technology budgets), would also study the software to see what it does, how it does it, and whether any of those capabilities happen to be features that law enforcement might find helpful Of course, if the U.S federal law enforcement community were to announce, several months later, that it had commissioned the development of "classified" quasi-viral computer-intrusion and surveillance software called "Magic Candle" the capabilities of which law enforcement does not plan to disclose to the public, and the source code for which will remain a closely-guarded secret then inquiring minds might become curious as to whether "Magic Candle" contains any of the GPLed code that was written for "GE3K" (or any other free or open-source software, for that matter) Needless to say, under the right factual circumstances, if any GPLed code from GE3K found its way into "Magic Candle," then the U.S
