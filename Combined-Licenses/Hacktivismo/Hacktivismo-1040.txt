The Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement does not in any way sacrifice or surrender the enforcement techniques and safeguards available under license agreements such as the GNU General Public License. Rather, the HESSLA enhances the options available to Hacktivismo and to qualified end-users, by providing additional enforcement options. Moreover, for the purpose of promoting the freedoms of both programers and end-users, through the enforced mandatory disclosure of code modified by third-parties, this License Agreement has advantages over many of the licenses (such as BSD-style licenses) that fully qualify as "free" or "open-source" license agreements.
