3.3 Restrictions. You may not (i) sell, lease, license, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer in whole or in part the Software or the Software License Key to another party; (ii) provide, disclose, divulge or make available to, or permit use of the Software in whole or in part by, any third party (except Designated Administrative Access) without VMware\xe2\x80\x99s prior written consent; (iii) modify or create derivative works based upon the Software; or (iv) create, develop, license, install, use, or deploy any third party software or services to circumvent, enable, modify or provide access, permissions or rights which violate the technical restrictions of the Software, any additional licensing terms provided by VMware via product documentation, notification, and/or policy change posted at www.vmware.com, and the terms of this EULA. Except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law, and to the extent that VMware is not permitted by that applicable law to exclude or limit the following rights, you may not decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive source code from the Software, in whole or in part. Before you exercise any rights that you believe to be entitled to based on mandatory law, you provide VMware with 30 days prior written notice at info@vmware.com and provide all reasonably requested information to allow VMware to assess your claim and, at VMware\xe2\x80\x99s sole discretion, to provide alternatives that reduce any adverse impact on VMware\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual property or other rights. You may use the Software to conduct internal performance testing and benchmarking studies, the results of which you (and not unauthorized third parties) may publish or publicly disseminate; provided that VMware has reviewed and approved of the methodology, assumptions and other parameters of the study. Please contact VMware at benchmark@vmware.com to request such review.
