# ODC Attribution License (ODC-By) ### Preamble The Open Data Commons Attribution License is a license agreement intended to allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database subject only to the attribution requirements set out in Section 4. Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example), and so this license only governs the rights over the Database, and not the contents of the Database individually Licensors may therefore wish to use this license together with another license for the contents. Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts, trademark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this License. ------ The Licensor (as defined below) and You (as defined below) agree as follows: ### 1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words "Collective Database" \xe2\x80\x93 Means this Database in unmodified form as part of a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are assembled into a collective whole A work that constitutes a Collective Database will not be considered a Derivative Database.
