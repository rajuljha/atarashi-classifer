You can use DOC software in commercial and/or binary software releases and are under no obligation to redistribute any of your source code that is built using DOC software. Note, however, that you may not misappropriate the DOC software code, such as copyrighting it yourself or claiming authorship of the DOC software code, in a way that will prevent DOC software from being distributed freely using an open-source development model. You needn't inform anyone that you're using DOC software in your software, though we encourage you to let us know so we can promote your project in the DOC software success stories.
