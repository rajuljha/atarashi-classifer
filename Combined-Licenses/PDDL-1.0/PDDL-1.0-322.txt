Rightsholders can also use this document to cover any copyright or database rights claims over only a database, and leave the contents to be covered by other licences or documents. They can do this because this document refers to the "Work", which can be either - or both - the database and its contents. As a result, rightsholders need to clearly state what they are dedicating under this document when they dedicate it.
