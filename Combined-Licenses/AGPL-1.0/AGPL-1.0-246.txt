The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the Affero General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This Public License applies to most of Affero's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Affero software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
