DOC software is provided with no support and without any obligation on the part of Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their employees, or students to assist in its use, correction, modification, or enhancement. A number of companies around the world provide commercial support for DOC software, however. DOC software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the underlying OS platform is Y2K-compliant. Likewise, DOC software is compliant with the new US daylight savings rule passed by Congress as "The Energy Policy Act of 2005," which established new daylight savings times (DST) rules for the United States that expand DST as of March 2007. Since DOC software obtains time/date and calendaring information from operating systems users will not be affected by the new DST rules as long as they upgrade their operating systems accordingly.
