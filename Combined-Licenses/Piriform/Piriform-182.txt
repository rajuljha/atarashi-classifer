An 'Installation' is defined as: \r\n(i) the installation of one copy of the Product on an individual physical device which does not have Virtualization Capability (as defined below); or \r\n(ii) each instance of the Product which is installed on a virtual machine operating on a device which has Virtualization Capability. \r\nWhere one copy of the Product is installed on a server but is accessible by multiple devices (whether physical or virtual), the Product shall be deemed to be installed both on the server and on each such device and each shall therefore be deemed an "Installation" for the purposes of this clause.
