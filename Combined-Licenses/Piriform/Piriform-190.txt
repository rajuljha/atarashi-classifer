This Agreement shall start on the date on which Piriform sends a confirmatory email to you confirming full payment of the support fees and issuing your user account details, and shall continue for a period of 1 year or for such other period as you may agree. \r\nIf you have purchased a yearly subscription for support, at the end of the year and any following year, this Agreement shall renew automatically for another year. Piriform (or its authorised agents or sub-contractors) will give you an opportunity to cancel your subscription in advance of the renewal date and will inform you of the renewal fees. Unless you notify Piriform by email before renewal that you do not want to renew, this Agreement will automatically renew.
