Server Side Public License VERSION 1, OCTOBER 16, 2018 Copyright \xc2\xa9 2018 MongoDB, Inc. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0 Definitions. \xe2\x80\x9cThis License\xe2\x80\x9d refers to Server Side Public License. \xe2\x80\x9cCopyright\xe2\x80\x9d also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Program\xe2\x80\x9d refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License Each licensee is addressed as \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLicensees\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crecipients\xe2\x80\x9d may be individuals or organizations. To \xe2\x80\x9cmodify\xe2\x80\x9d a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy The resulting work is called a \xe2\x80\x9cmodified version\xe2\x80\x9d of the earlier work or a work \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d the earlier work. A \xe2\x80\x9ccovered work\xe2\x80\x9d means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To \xe2\x80\x9cpropagate\xe2\x80\x9d a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \xe2\x80\x9cconvey\xe2\x80\x9d a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays \xe2\x80\x9cAppropriate Legal Notices\xe2\x80\x9d to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1 Source Code. The \xe2\x80\x9csource code\xe2\x80\x9d for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it \xe2\x80\x9cObject code\xe2\x80\x9d means any non-source form of a work. A \xe2\x80\x9cStandard Interface\xe2\x80\x9d means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language The \xe2\x80\x9cSystem Libraries\xe2\x80\x9d of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form A \xe2\x80\x9cMajor Component\xe2\x80\x9d, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The \xe2\x80\x9cCorresponding Source\xe2\x80\x9d for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 2 Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program, subject to section 13 The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law Subject to section 13, you may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3 Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4 Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program
