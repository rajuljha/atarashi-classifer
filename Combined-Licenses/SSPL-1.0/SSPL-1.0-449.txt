   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the Server Side Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by MongoDB, Inc. If the Program does not specify a version number of the Server Side Public License, you may choose any version ever published by MongoDB, Inc.
