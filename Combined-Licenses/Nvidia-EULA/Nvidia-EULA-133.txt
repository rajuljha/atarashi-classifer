Use of NVIDIA's products requires three elements: the SOFTWARE, the hardware on a graphics controller board, and a personal computer. The SOFTWARE is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE is not sold, and instead is only licensed for use, strictly in accordance with this document. The hardware is protected by various patents, and is sold, but this LICENSE does not cover that sale, since it may not necessarily be sold as a package with the SOFTWARE. This LICENSE sets forth the terms and conditions of the SOFTWARE LICENSE only.
