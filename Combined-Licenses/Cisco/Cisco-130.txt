Multiple-Users License Grant: Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco") and its suppliers grant to Customer ("Customer") a nonexclusive and nontransferable license to use the Cisco software ("Software") in object code form: (i) installed in a single location on a hard disk or other storage device of up to the number of computers owned or leased by Customer for which Customer has paid a license fee ("Permitted Number of Computers"); or (ii) provided the Software is configured for network use, installed on a single file server for use on a single local area network for either (but not both) of the following purposes: (a) permanent installation onto a hard disk or other storage device of up to the Permitted Number of Computers; or (b) use of the Software over such network, provided the number of computers connected to the server does not exceed the Permitted Number of Computers. Customer may only use the programs contained in the Software (i) for which Customer has paid a license fee (or in the case of an evaluation copy, those programs Customer is authorized to evaluate) and (ii) for which Customer has received a product authorization key ("PAK"). Customer grants to Cisco or its independent accountants the right to examine its books, records and accounts during Customer's normal business hours to verify compliance with the above provisions. In the event such audit discloses that the Permitted Number of Computers is exceeded, Customer shall promptly pay to Cisco the appropriate licensee fee for the additional computers or users. At Cisco's option, Cisco may terminate this license for failure to pay the required license fee.
