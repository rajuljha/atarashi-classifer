a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\r\nb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\nc) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\nd) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\r\n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)
