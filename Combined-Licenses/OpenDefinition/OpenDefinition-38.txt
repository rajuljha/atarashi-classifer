The Open Source Definition (Annotated) Version 1.9 The indented, italicized sections below appear as annotations to the Open Source Definition (OSD) and are not a part of the OSD A plain version of the OSD without annotations can be found here. Introduction Open source doesn't just mean access to the source code The distribution terms of open-source software must comply with the following criteria: 1 Free Redistribution The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale. Rationale: By constraining the license to require free redistribution, we eliminate the temptation to throw away many long-term gains in order to make a few short-term sales dollars If we didn't do this, there would be lots of pressure for cooperators to defect. 2 Source Code The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost preferably, downloading via the Internet without charge The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed. Rationale: We require access to un-obfuscated source code because you can't evolve programs without modifying them Since our purpose is to make evolution easy, we require that modification be made easy. 3 Derived Works The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software. Rationale: The mere ability to read source isn't enough to support independent peer review and rapid evolutionary selection For rapid evolution to happen, people need to be able to experiment with and redistribute modifications. 4 Integrity of The Author's Source Code The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of "patch files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time
