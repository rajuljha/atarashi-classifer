The Open Source Definition (Annotated) Version 1.9 The indented, italicized sections below appear as annotations to the Open Source Definition (OSD) and are not a part of the OSD A plain version of the OSD without annotations can be found here. Introduction Open source doesn't just mean access to the source code The distribution terms of open-source software must comply with the following criteria: 1 Free Redistribution The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale. Rationale: By constraining the license to require free redistribution, we eliminate the temptation to throw away many long-term gains in order to make a few short-term sales dollars
