The Open Source Definition (Annotated) Version 1.9 The indented, italicized sections below appear as annotations to the Open Source Definition (OSD) and are not a part of the OSD A plain version of the OSD without annotations can be found here. Introduction Open source doesn't just mean access to the source code The distribution terms of open-source software must comply with the following criteria: 1 Free Redistribution The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale. Rationale: By constraining the license to require free redistribution, we eliminate the temptation to throw away many long-term gains in order to make a few short-term sales dollars If we didn't do this, there would be lots of pressure for cooperators to defect. 2 Source Code The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost preferably, downloading via the Internet without charge The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program
