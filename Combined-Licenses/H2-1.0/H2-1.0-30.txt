You can use H2 for free. You can integrate it into your applications (including in commercial applications), and you can distribute it.\r\nFiles containing only your code are not covered by this license (it is 'commercial friendly').\r\nModifications to the H2 source code must be published.\r\nYou don't need to provide the source code of H2 if you did not modify anything.\r\nIf you distribute a binary that includes H2, you need to add a disclaimer of liability - see the example below.\r\nHowever, nobody is allowed to rename H2, modify it a little, and sell it as a database engine without telling the customers it is in fact H2. This happened to HSQLDB: a company called 'bungisoft' copied HSQLDB, renamed it to 'RedBase', and tried to sell it, hiding the fact that it was in fact just HSQLDB. It seems 'bungisoft' does not exist any more, but you can use the Wayback Machine and visit old web pages of http://www.bungisoft.com.
