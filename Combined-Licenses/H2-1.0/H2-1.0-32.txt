If you distribute a binary that includes H2, you need to add the license and a disclaimer of liability (as you should do for your own code). You should add a disclaimer for each open source libraries you use. For example, add a file 3rdparty_license.txt in the directory where the jar files are, and list all open source libraries, each one with its license and disclaimer. For H2, a simple solution is to copy the following text below. You may also include a copy of the complete license.\r\nhttp://www.h2database.com/html/license.html#h2_license
