1.  THE SOFTWARE.  Fedora (the "Software") is a modular Linux\r\noperating system consisting of hundreds of software components. The\r\nend user license agreement for each component is located in the\r\ncomponent's source code.  With the exception of certain image files\r\ncontaining the Fedora trademark identified in Section 2 below, the\r\nlicense terms for the components permit User to copy and\r\nredistribute the component.  With the potential exception of certain\r\nfirmware files (denoted in the License field of the RPM packaging),\r\nthe license terms for the components permit User to copy, modify and\r\nredistribute the component, in both source code and binary code\r\nforms.  This agreement does not limit User's rights under, or grant\r\nUser rights that supersede, the license terms of any particular\r\ncomponent.
